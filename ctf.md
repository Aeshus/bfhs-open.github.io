The computer science club is participating in the PicoCTF competition from Carnegie Mellon Univsersity. It is a two week long event, in which team members can solve computer science related problems individually or as a group to earn points. It is a great way to get involved and to learn something new. We hope to make this a yearly event, and sign up for other hackathons as well.

2022's competition goes from March 15 to March 29. We will be meeting during the normal times to work through problems together, in addition to extra time that we schedule.

There are no real requirements for participating in the CTF. Access to a Linux system and some programming knowledge is recommended, however, the PicoCTF website does offer a webshell to connect to a Linux server. The problems vary in difficulty and subject matter, so learning something new and doing additional research to solve a problem is inevitable. With that in mind, we hope to see you at our meetings to have some fun hacking!
